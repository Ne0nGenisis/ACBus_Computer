As of April of 2022, the project was put on pause but my hyperfixation has shifted back to computers and I'm considering picking this project back up. As an aside, I also have a job now (thanks, therapy), so I have the ability to purchase my parts and boards eventually. At the time this project was paused, my focus had shifted away from an AT-style motherboard with PC-style system component cards to something that would be able to be produced on the prototyping rates offered by companies such as PCB Way and JLCPCB, 10x10cm boards on a small multi-socket backplane. An integrated single board design and keyboard interpreter was also tentatively in the works, but it was slow going. Helps me understand why computers take so long to design hardware for. 

Instead of using 64-pin edge connectors, the modern Durandal ACBus prototype design utilizes a 96-pin DIN 41612 connector, also featured on Apple's Processor Direct Slots (PDS) and NUBUS, but inverted, utilizing pin connectors on the backplane side and right-angle socket connectors on the card side, though the pin arrangement on the board also allows for blocks of 2.54mm/0.1" pitch pin headers to be used. While cheaper, they are also harder to find.
